# Can Foundation Models Help Us Achieve Perfect Secrecy? A simple baseline for personal & private ML.

This repository explores the baseline of using in-context learning for personal & private machine learning! We include scripts to download data and evaluate foundation models of various sizes and types across popular personal machine learning benchmarks from the privacy literature. Additional information can be found in the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13722. Contributions of additional benchmarks and baselines are welcome in the form of PRs to the benchmarks folder and additions of a data loader. Exciting future questions: 

- Do we see further personalization with more in-context examples and longer contexts? 
- Can we understand the limits of this baseline in a
